# Trace My Ride
Trace My Ride is a web app for tracing and mapping my route as I ride my motorcycle. I wanted to make a website where my family could login and view where I have ridden, as I ride.

There's two parts to the project, this web app and an iOS app. The rider uses the iOS app to record rides, and the web app maps the ride behind a login portal. More details to come.
